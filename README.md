# pymaceuticals
This repository contains the starter code and data the Module 5 Challenge Pymaceuticals. References include Pandas and Matplotlib documentation, Tutorials Point, Geeks for Geeks, W3 Schools, and Saturn Cloud. The code for calculating the IQR and the outliers comes directly from Tutorials Point. The name on the page is Rohan Singh. Saturn Cloud was the source of the code for dropping the duplicate mice. Geeks for Geeks was the source of the code for creating the boxplot. I may have also used the website Statology, and Python Charts with the contributor being R Coder. Most of the rest of the code is pretty standard convention.
